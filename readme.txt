An unobtrusive debugging tool for WordPress

== Description ==
Have you ever wanted to get debug output sent to you from WordPress without interrupting the flow of the page?  
Do you ever wish you could get debug output from _other users'_ sessions so you don't have to:

- Log in as them
- Asking them to look at debug output themselves (bleh)
- Or try in vain to re-create their issue

This plugin allows you to send debug messages via UDP to a [Jabber Bot](https://github.com/borkweb/jabberbot) that can then route
the debug information to your IM client.

_Note: This plugin sends the messages via UDP.  The receiving end doesn't necessarily need to be a Jabber bot...it could be anything you want
(e.g. email bot, logger, whatever).  My implementation is a Jabber Bot on my local dev environment :)_

= Usage =
To send debug messages, simply call:

`do_action( 'debug_robot', $message [, $target ]);`

- **$message**: Message to send to your jabber bot.
- **$target**: _(optional)_ Email address that your jabber bot will route the message to.

To receive debug messages, you will need to have:

- Your [Jabber Bot](https://github.com/borkweb/jabberbot) installed and configured.
- The Jabber Bot must be running.
- You must have friended your robot's jabber account with another jabber account (e.g. your Google account).
- You must be signed into Google Talk in some way shape or form so that your jabber bot can IM you.

_Note: If your Jabber Bot isn't running, no worries.  UDP doesn't wait for a response so it won't impact your WordPress instance...you just won't get the messages that
are sent until your bot is running :)_

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `wp-debug-robot` folder to your plugins directory (e.g. `wp-content/plugins`)
2. Got to Settings > Debug Robot and configure your settings.  
3. Set the `host` and `port` of the server you wish to send debug messages to.
4. Set the default `target` email address that debug messages will be routed to by a Jabber bot.
5. Configure a [Jabber Bot](https://github.com/borkweb/jabberbot) 

_Note: you will also need a dummy jabber email address to act as your jabber bot.  I created one with Google Apps called robot@mydomain.com then friended that account with my primary Google account._

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= You mention a jabber bot.  What is that all about? =
This plugin allows your WordPress installation to send UDP packets containing debug information to...some place.  The jabber bot is a service that runs on a the location you configure your Debug Settings to point to.  When doing development on my localhost, I can run my jabberbot on my localhost as well so my dev environment sends debug info to the same machine it is running on.  Another example that I have running: There is a machine in my office with the jabberbot running at all times.  My co-workers at Gigaom and me - as long as we're on our local network - can use the jabber bot by pointing their Debug Robot settings to the machine running the bot!  Super easy.

== Credits ==
This code was largely written by [@abackstrom](https://github.com/abackstrom) with some additions by me while we worked at [@PlymouthState](https://github.com/PlymouthState). I then ported it into a WordPress plugin.
